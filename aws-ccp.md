## Notes

### Cloud Concepts

#### What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing: using a network of remote servers hosted on the Internet to store/access/manage/processo data, rather than a local server or personal computer

| On-premise                      | Cloud Providers                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| You own the server              | Someone else owns the server                                                                         |
| You hire IT people              | Someone eslse hires IT people                                                                        |
| You pay or rent the real-estate | Someone else payes or rents the real-estate                                                          |
| You take all the risk           | You are responsible for configuring your cloud services and code, someone else take care of the rest |

#### Why go with a cloud provider over on-premise?

- _Trade capital expense for variable expense_ **No upfront-cost** **Pay On-Demand**
- _Benefit from massive economies of scale_
- _Stop guessing capacity_ No need to guess the sizing of the infrastructure.
- _Increase speed and agility_ Lauch resources within minutes
- _Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers_
- _Go global in minutes_ Deploy in multiples regions around the world with a few clicks

#### Types of Cloud Computing

- _SaaS_ **For Customers** A completed product that is run and managed by the the service provider.
  Don't worry about how the service is maintained. It just works and remain available.
- _PaaS_ **For Developers** Removes the need for your organisation to manage the underlying infrastructure. Focus on the deployment and management of your applications.
  Don't worry about provisioning, configuring or understanding the hardware or OS.
- _IaaS_ **For Admins** The basic building blocks for cloud IT. Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space.
  Don't worry about IT staff, data centers and hardware.
  **AWS is here**

#### Cloud Computing Deployment Models

- _Cloud_ Fully utilizing cloud computing
  This includes _startups_, _SaaS offerings_ and _new projects and companies_
- _Hybrid_ Using both Cloud and On-Premise
  This includes _Banks_, _Fintech_, _Large Professional Service Providers_, _Legacy on-premise_
- _On-Premise_ Deploying resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools, is sometimes called 'private cloud'
  This includes _public sector_, _sensitive data (hospital)_, _Large entreprise with heavy regulation (insurance companies)_

### AWS Global Infrastructure

69 Availability Zones (AZ) within 22 Geographic Regions around the world. Way more Edge Locations than AZ!

_Regions_ are physical location in the world with multiple Availibity Zones

_Availability Zones_ are one or more discrete data centers

_Edge Locations_ are datacenter owned by a trusted partner of AWS

#### [Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/)

A geographically distinct location which has mutliple datacenters (AZs).

Every region is _physically isolated_ from and independent of every other region in terms of location, power, water supply.

Each region has at least 2 AZs.

AWS largest region is _US-EAST_.

New services almost always launch first in _US-EAST_.

Not all services are available in all regions. You can see on the [regional table](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/?p=ngi&loc=4) what services are available in each region.

_US-EAST-1_ is the region where you see all your billing information.

#### [Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/?p=ngi&loc=2)

A datacenter owned and operated by AWS in which AWS services run.

Each region has at least two AZs (most region have 3 or more)

AZ are represented by a Region Code, followed by a letter identifier eg. us-east-1a

**Multi-AZ** Distributing your instances across multiple AZs allows failover configuration for handling requests when one goes down.

<10ms latency between AZs of a same region
<100km between AZs of a same region

#### [Edge Locations](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/?p=ngi&loc=2)

Get data fast or upload data fast to AWS.

An Edge Location is a datacenter owned by a trusted partner of AWS which has a **direct connection** to the AWS network.

These locations serve requests for **CloudFront** and **Route 53**. Requests going to either of these services will be routed to the nearest edge location automatically.

**S3 Transfer Acceleration** traffic and **API Gateway** endpoint traffic alsu use the AWS Egde Network.

This allow for _low latency_ no matter where the end user is geographically located.

#### [GovCloud Regions](https://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/)

AWS GovCloud Regions allow customers to host sensitive **Controlled Unclassified Information** and other types of regulated workloads.

GovCloud Region are only operated by employees who are U.S. citizen, on U.S. soil.

They are only accessible to U.S. entities and root account holders who pass a screening process.

Customers can architect secure cloud solutions that comply with:

- FedRAMP High Baseline
- DOJ's Criminal Justice Information Systems (CJIS) Security Policy
- U.S. International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR)
- Export Administration REgulatioins (EAR)
- Deparment of Defense (DoD) Cloud Computing Security Requirement Guide

### Hands on lab

#### IAM

Where you create user/group and policies for password, what kind of endpoint you activate/disable etc

MFA can(should) be activated [here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home#/security_credentials)

_You should not use the root password for your everyday usage of AWS_. Create an user with admin capability and use this one.

#### Session Manager

Instead of using SSH we can use Session Manager to access services.
For EC2 for example, it means you don't need to have SSH ports open on the instances you lauch. It also mean that administrators can give access to the session manager to some user, and even choose which instance inside of the session manager they are allowed to use.

Session manager integrate with _CloudTrail_, _S3_, _CloudWatch Logs_, _CloudWatch Events_ and _Amazon SNS_ to log and audit session activity.

![Example of session manager](resources/session_manager.png)

You can see above that you are logged as root by default, so you have to use `sudo su - ubuntu` to use the user `ubuntu` (was the default user in my case)

The strength of it is that by using sessions, you can log and audit who is logging in and out of the system.

![Session History](resources/session_manager_history.png)

#### Amazon Machine Image (AMI)

An AMI is like a blueprint for an instance. When creating the AMI, you configure it (EBS snapshots, OS, application server, permissions, volumes to attach to it etc)

We can create an AMI for an already existing EC2 instance.

You need an AMI to use Auto Scaling Groups

![Here is a test AMI](test_ami.png)

#### Auto Scaling Groups

Allow to scale servers with a set of rules. Good to ensure at least a mininum number of machine are up, or when you need to grow capacity.

#### Elastic Launch Balancer ELB

Distribute traffic between multiple instance. The goal is to have instances in multiple AZs, in case one has a failure, the other one will get the traffic from the load balancer and the application/users will not be impacted.

![Three types of Load Balancer](load_balancer_three_propositions.png)

#### Simple Storage Service S3

Store any data, lots of type of storage depending on the access pattern

#### CloudFront

CDN service, can be used in conjunction with S3 (and other services) to deliver content to users with good performance.

### Trivia (don't know how to title this)

#### Pricing Model - EC2

- **On-Demand**
  Flexible, pay by the hour
  Can be good for short-term unpredictable workload
  Small apps / first time apps
- **Spot** (upto 90% saving)
  Needs a task that is flexible with the start/end time, and can handle interruptions
  Used for non-critical background jobs
  AWS Batch is an easy way to use Spot pricing

  **Termination condition**

  - instances can be terminated by AWS _at any time_
  - if you instance is terminated by AWS, _you don't get charged_ for a partial hour of usage
  - if _you terminate_ an instance, _you will be charged_ for any hour that it ran

- **Reserved** (upto 75% off)
  Steady/predictable usage
  Commit to EC2 over a 1 or 3 year term
  Can resell unused reserved instances
  Can pay _upfront_, _partial upfront_ or _no upfront_. The greater the upfront the better the saving.
  Either

  - _Standard_ (up to 75% saving) you cannot change RI attributes
  - _Convertible_ (up to 54% saving). Allows to change RI attributes if greater or equal in value.
  - _Scheduled_ (variable savings). You reserve instances for specific time periods

  RI can be shared between mutliple accounts within an org.
  Unused RI can be sold in the _Reserved Instance Marketplace_

- **Dedicated** (expensive)
  Dedicated servers
  Can be on-demand or reserved
  When you need a guarantee of isolated hardware (because of regulation or server-bound licensing)

### Security

#### [Shared Responsibility Model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/)

Having the right idea about what you are in charge of configuring/protecting, and what is AWS's responsability.

Basically, AWS is responsible for the infrastructure (how to setup the regions, AZs, Edge locations, datacenter, hardware) and also to tune/maintain the software for the compute, storage, database and networking.

You are in charge:

- server-side encryption (file system and/or data)
- client-side data encryption & data integrity, authentication
- networking traffic protection (encryption, integrity, identity)
- operating system, network and firewall configuration
- platform, applications identity & access management
- customer data

_Another way of putting it_:

Customer is responsible for security **IN** the cloud. (data, configuration)
AWS is responsible for security **OF** the cloud. (hardware, operation of managed services, global infrastructure)

#### [AWS Compliance Programs](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/)

A set of internal policies and procedures of a company to comply with laws, rules and regulations or to uphold business reputation.

Two important:

- _HIPAA_ Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act - in the US, to work with medical information
- _PCI DSS_ Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard - When you want to sell things online and you need to handle credit card information

Full list: https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/programs/

#### AWS Artifact

_How do we prove AWS meets a compliance?_

No cost, serlf-service portal for on-demand access to AWS compliance reports.

#### Amazon Inspector
